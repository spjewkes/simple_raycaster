# Simple Raycaster

This is work in progress. I just want to create something simple to play with SDL.

Currently developing on Mac OS X so this is not expected to be platform independent yet.

It was inspired by the console FPS developed by One Lone Coder: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS/blob/master/CommandLineFPS.cpp
